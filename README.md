# how to open in android studio (i think???)
1. if a project is open, click file -> close project
2. click 'get from VCS'
3. in the URL field, paste the URL of this repo (https://github.com/maxdgeller/doorMAT)
4. change the Directory field if it conflicts with an existing project folder
5. click 'Clone' at the bottom of the window
6. in the 'Trust Gradle Project?' dialog box, click Trust Project. or click stay in safe mode. i don't know the implications of either. lol.

# if the following instructions don't work, they probably will once i add you as a collaborator
## to apply others' remote changes to your local project (before making changes locally)
in the android studio project, navigate to Git -> Update Project, select 'Merge incoming changes int othe current branch'
## to apply your local changes to the repo
Git -> Commit, and click 'Commit and Push...'
