# how to open in android studio (i think???)
1. if a project is open, click file -> close project
2. click 'get from VCS'
3. in the URL field, paste the URL of this repo (https://github.com/maxdgeller/doorMAT)
4. change the Directory field if it conflicts with an existing project folder
5. click 'Clone' at the bottom of the window
6. in the 'Trust Gradle Project?' dialog box, click Trust Project. or click stay in safe mode. i don't know the implications of either. lol.

# if the following instructions don't work, they probably will once i add you as a collaborator
## to apply local changes to the repo
in the android studio project, navigate to Git -> Commit, and click 'Commit and Push...'
## to apply remote changes to local project
Git -> Update Project, select 'Merge incoming changes int othe current branch'
